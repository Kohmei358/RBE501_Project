<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://youtu.be/84nr0pFNmIE)

In this project, we have developed a simulated model of the quadruped and dynamic analysis of legs of quadruped is done. Based on the analysis, control techniques were designed for the quadruped, which enables us to achieve the desired gaits. Simulation of the model was done using Simscape Multibody along with MATLAB.

### Goals
* Initial Design and Configuration
* Frame assignment and Kinematics computation
* SolidWorks Design and Importing to Simscape Multibody
* Dynamics Formulation and Trajectory PLanning
* Generating Torque Profiles
* Gait Testing

This was forked so that I could link this code in [my website](https://kohmeik.com). Please do not reference any of the code or UX design if you are currently enrolled in Software Engineering! The learning experience is so much better if you do not look at examples of previous work and your team will end up with a better final product if you brainstorm based on your surveys and interviews.
